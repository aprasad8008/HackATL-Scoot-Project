    <h1> Future Improvements for Scoot</h1>
    <p> The plans we have for Scoot right now are not as big as we eventually want them to be. We have several ideas for improvements in the future.</p>

    <h2> Priority</h2>
       <ul>
 	<li>Show the battery percentage of a specific Bird </li>
 	<li>A map that shows the density of where the most Birds are</li>
 	<li>Possibly reserving a Bird so no one can access it but you as you walk to it</li>
 	<li><b>Bird points:</b> make someone get one that’s not in a “hot spot” so it’s in rotation again</li>
 </ul>
